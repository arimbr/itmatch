For us is more important what you want to learn that what you already know.

We are trying our best to build a web application that helps you to :

  - connect with others (students) that
    - share the same interests (technology)
    - spend regular time in the same area (Leppavaara campus)
  
All that for you to:

  - form groups
  - do project work
  - have fun learning

This is a project for the course Orientation Project. And we are learning a lot together.
