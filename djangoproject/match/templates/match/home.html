<p>We are trying our best to build a web application that helps you to connect with others that share similar interests and spend time in the same area.</p>
<p>First, we will focus on students interested in programming in the Metropolia Leppavaara campus.</p>
<p>All that for you to form groups, build something together and have fun learning.</p>
