Team members: Ari, Joakim, Sajjad

[Goal of project]

- To solve the problem of having to manually match people (for making groups) with similar interests.

[Technology strategy]

- Basic knowledge of source code management system "Git"
- Python programming language
- Basic knowledge of Python web framework "Django"
- JSON data interchange structure
- To-do list application "Wunderlist"
- Unix operating system "Ubuntu" distribution

[Requirements]

- User data entry interface
- Data processing algorithm
- Data presentation

[Function]

- Our project could save time and money, and could suggest the best possible matches so efficiently that is time consuming in real world.

[Program plan]

- Writing the program and putting it on web as soon as possible with the simplest methods and algorithms and then making it more complex.

[Implementation]

Our approach is to make the final version first with the simplest algorithms and features and then make it more complex by time.

V1:

1) we have data pre-defined on the local computer
2) the user goes to the "result" page hosted in the local computer
3) there is a django model for Users, Tags and Distances between users in a database
4) the user gets the html template with the recommendations for each user
# we have only one page at this version, the "results" page

V2:

1) we provide a page where user can submit his/her data
2) the database tables are updated after new data is submitted
3) the results page is created dynamically after each request
4) select database
5) deploy the code to server
# we have one additional page in this version called "submit"

V2.1:

1) grouping algorithm is chosen and developed.

2) providing visualization of the groups made by the chosen algorithm in the results page. 

V3:

1) creating administration profile that have access to modify categories.
2) creating users profile where users can modify their data.
*** every approach should be tested with "satisfaction test", both within individual groups and the global satisfaction average.
