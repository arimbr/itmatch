[Goal of project]

The goal of the project is to create a web application that helps people with similar interests to connect and make groups for projects

[Technology strategy]

- Basic knowledge of source code management system "Git"
- Python programming language
- Basic knowledge of Python web framework "Django"
- JSON data interchange structure
- To-do list application "Wunderlist"
- Unix operating system "Ubuntu" distribution

[Requirements]

- User data entry interface
- Data processing algorithm
- Data presentation

[Function]

Our project could suggest the best possible matches of people for project groups, saving time compared to manual grouping.
Project scope is initially only for orientation project group creation, can be extended to whole Metropolia with sufficient resources.

[Implementation]

Our approach is to make the initial version first with the basic feature set and then add features as time allows.

V1:

1) We have data pre-defined on the local computer
2) The user goes to the "result" page hosted in the local computer
3) There is a Django model for Users, Tags and Distances between users in a database
4) The user gets the html template with the recommendations for each user
# We have only one page at this version, the "results" page

V2:

1) We provide a page where user can submit his/her data
2) The database tables are updated after new data is submitted
3) The results page is created dynamically after each request
4) Select database
5) Deploy the code to server
# We have one additional page in this version called "submit"

V3:

1) Grouping algorithm is chosen and developed
2) Providing visualization of the data

V4:

1) Creating administration profile that have access to modify categories.
2) Creating users profile where users can modify their data.
3) Authentication system

[Program plan]

Aiming for implementing:
- V1 by 11.3.2014
- V2 by 25.3.2014
- V3 by 8.4.2014
- (V4 optional)
